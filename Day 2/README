Question: 
         Write a program to find the size of garments using switch case:
	 Take input from use as a single character:
		s-extra small
		S-small
		M-medium
		l-large
		L-extra Large .

Programming Language:
                     JAVA

Input: 
      Size of array which is stored a variable named opr.

Output:
       Categorize garments based on their size in extra small, small, medium, large, extra large.
		

Test Cases:
	   Case 1: 
		  Size = s
			print-"extra small"

           Case 2: 
		  Size = S
			 print-"small"
	   Case 3:
		  Size = M
			 print-"medium"
	   Case 4:
		  Size = l
			 print-"large"
	   Case 5:
		 Size = L
			print-"extra large"
	   Case 6:
		 Size = A
			print-"wrong"
			
	
Logic:
      Here the following problem is sloving in switch case statement , where first taking an input from user that is "s","S","M","l","L".
	now taking choice from user which is a character form will be stored in char variable 'opr'.
	When user entered "s" then case 1 is satisfied, the program will print "extra small" 
	When user entered "S" then case 2 is satisfied, the program will print "small" 
	When user entered "M" then case 3 is satisfied, the program will print "medium" 
	When user entered "l" then case 4 is satisfied, the program will print "large" 
	When user entered "L" then case 5 is satisfied, the program will print "extra large" 
	When user entered "A" then case 6 is satisfied, the program will print "wrong"
