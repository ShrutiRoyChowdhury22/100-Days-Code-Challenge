# Strings
Today, I solved a HackerRank Question on strings.

## Question Link:
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-strings-introduction/problem?isFullScreen=true

## Task
Given two strings of lowercase English letters,A and B, perform the following operations:

* Sum the lengths of A and B.
* Determine if A is lexicographically larger than B (i.e.: does B come before A in the dictionary?).
* Capitalize the first letter in A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

## Sample Test Case
Input
```
hello
java
```
Output
```
9
No
Hello Java
```
