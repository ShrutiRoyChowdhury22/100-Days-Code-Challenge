Question:
	 A company decided to give bonus of 5% to employee if his/her year of service is more than 5 years. Ask user for their salary and year of service and print the net bonus amount.


Programming Language:

Input:
      An integer variable , year.
      A double variable , salary.

Output:

Test Case:
	  Case 1:
		 Salary = 15000
		 year = 6
		      print = 750.0

	   Case 2:
		 Salary = 10000
