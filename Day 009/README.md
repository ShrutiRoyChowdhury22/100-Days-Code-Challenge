# Java If-Else
Today I solved a HackerRank Question of Conditional Statements in Java.

## Task
Given an integer,n, perform the following conditional actions:<br>

If n is odd, print Weird<br>
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird<br>
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird<br>
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird<br>
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not  is weird.<br>

## Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer, n.

## Output Format
Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.
